Enemies 2 & 3 both seem to jitter around for some reason even when they're walking randomly and using the same code as Enemy 1.

The Player seems to get stuck in a loop going the same path back and forth every now and again.

The main problem I had was trying to figure out how to choose a random tile within a few tiles of the player for the 3rd Enemies movement, But it seems to be fixed now.
